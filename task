Please start doing python exercises.

Before starting
1. Understand each question properly, if you have doubt in any of the questions, please let me know
2. Create a new Git repo and add me as a collaborator hms@taglineinfotech.com
3. For each question you should create a new branch from main branch, do the code in that and push to the github.
4. Then raise the pull request (PR) of branch against main branch
5. Send me the link of PR, I will review it, provide you comments if needed, and will merge it.
